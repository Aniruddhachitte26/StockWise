# StockWise - Smart Stock Trading & Investment Platform

StockWise is a comprehensive web application designed for stock trading, portfolio management, and market analysis. It provides users with tools to track stocks, manage their investments, view market news, and interact with an AI assistant for financial insights. The platform caters to regular users, brokers, and administrators, each with dedicated functionalities.

## ✨ Key Features

* **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for users, brokers, and admins. Includes Google OAuth integration and password reset functionality (OTP via email & Redis).

* **User Roles:**
    * **Users:** Manage portfolio, watchlist, transactions, profile, wallet, interact with chatbot. Requires admin verification for full features.
    * **Brokers:** Manage assigned clients, view/process transactions (TBD - needs backend logic).
    * **Admin:** User management (view, verify, reject, potentially disable), dashboard with statistics, view pending verifications.

* **Portfolio Management:** Track owned stocks, average prices, quantities, total value, and overall gains/losses.

* **Watchlist:** Add and remove stocks for easy tracking.

* **Stock Information:** Browse stock listings, view detailed stock pages with charts and company information.

* **Trading Simulation:** Buy and sell stocks (updates portfolio and wallet balance, records transactions).

* **AI Chatbot:** Integrated chatbot (using OpenRouter API) to answer stock-related questions, potentially leveraging user portfolio context.

* **Wallet System:** Users have a virtual wallet, can add funds via Stripe integration.

* **User Verification:** Admin approval workflow for user accounts, including proof document upload (e.g., License, Passport) stored via Multer.

* **Profile Management:** Users can view and update their profile information (name, contact, address). Admins can potentially update user status.

* **Responsive UI:** Built with React and Bootstrap for adaptability across devices.

* **State Management:** Uses Redux Toolkit for managing application state, particularly authentication.

* **Theming:** Includes a theme provider structure (currently only light theme implemented).

# Database
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret

# Redis (for OTP)
REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
REDIS_USERNAME=your_redis_username

# Email Service (for notifications and OTP)
EMAIL_USERNAME=your_email_address
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_email_app_password

# Frontend URL (for email links)
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# APIs
